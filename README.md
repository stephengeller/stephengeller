## Hello!

**My name is Stephen and I am an ambitious software engineer based in London, UK.** I pick up new skills very quickly, and can produce clean tested code following best practices.

I am a graduate from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) - a 12-week intensive development bootcamp - and am currently employed at [The Guardian](https://gu.com) as a Software Engineer, specialising in tools and infrastructure.

I love learning a diverse range of technologies both through my work and experimentation, and consistently endorse Agile methodologies and XP values to help deliver the highest quality code with efficiency. I love improving processes, empowering other engineers and finding the best way of solving a problem.

I'm a polyglot engineer, but I tend to write Typescript, JS, Python, Shell and Ruby most often. I'm slowly getting my head around Scala.

You can find out more about me by viewing [My Manual Of Me](https://github.com/stephengeller/user_manual_for_me).
